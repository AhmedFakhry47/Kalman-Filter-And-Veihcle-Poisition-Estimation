# Kalman-Filter-And-Veihcle-Poisition-Estimation
Testing the kalman filter with a very simple example which is :
-A veihcle that is moving on straight rails, it's initially stationary at position zero
-There are two state variables ( Position x , Velocity x ) and this simplification is for having a linear system

# Dependencies
-Numpy 
-Matplot Library
